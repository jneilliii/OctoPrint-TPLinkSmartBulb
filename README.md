or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-TPLinkSmarBulb/archive/master.zip


## Configuration

Once installed go into settings and enter the ip address for your TP-Link SmartBulb. Adjust additional settings as needed.

## Settings Explained
- **IP**
  - IP or hostname of bulb to control.
- **Label**
  - Label to use for title attribute on hover over button in navbar.
- **Icon Class**
  - Class name from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1/icons/) to use for icon on button.
- **Warning Prompt**
  - Always warn when checked.
- **Warn While Printing**
  - Will only warn when printer is printing.
- **GCODE Trigger**
  - When checked this will enable the processing of M80 and M81 commands from gcode to power on/off bulb.  Syntax for gcode command is M80/M81 followed by hostname/ip.  For example if your bulb is 192.168.1.2 your gcode command would be **M80 192.168.1.2**
  - When enabled M150 GCODE commands will also get translated and submitted to the bulb to change the color of the bulb. Use the format M150 R<value> U<value> B<value> P<value> W<value> I<bulb ip>. For example `M150 I192.168.1.2 R255 G128 B128 P128` will turn the bulb with ip 192.168.1.2 to an orangish color at 50% brightness.
  - **Auto Connect**
  - Automatically connect to printer after bulb is powered on.
  - Will wait for number of seconds configured in **Auto Connect Delay** setting prior to attempting connection to printer.
- **Auto Disconnect**
  - Automatically disconnect printer prior to powering off the bulb.
  - Will wait for number of seconds configured in **Auto Disconnect Delay** prior to powering off the bulb.
- **Run System Command After On**
